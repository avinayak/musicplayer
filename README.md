Java Music Player
=================

This is a Music Player written in Java with features like Music Queue,Seeking
and all the ususal stuff you get from a normal music player. It uses the swing
GUI Framework, sqlite 3 database for organising tracks and dual music engines
(Java Media Framework and VLCj) to do the playback.

It still needs work.
